# classification_workflow
This is a project I did as part of the application process for a Data Science role. It showcases my approach to supervised classification problems. 

The project was based around data that represented attributes about properties from 2 sources: HomeAway and Airbnb. A  `train` set was provided
that had a binary `match` column that was 1 in cases where 2 attribute sets represented the same property. 

The task was to use this label and the features contained in the dataset describing the properties to train a model that could predict
whether or not two feature sets were a match, i.e. represented the same property on two different sites. 

Reading through the project shows my approach from exploring the data, to feature engineering, to applying logistic regression, and interpretation of the results.

If you look through this notebook you may see an impossibly good ROC result from the trained classifier, the reason for this is that 
the train data give to me had it's labels generated by the data providers own model. Training a classifier on labels output from another
classifier explains why the results look so great.
